    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      UmaStitcher! respects your privacy and is committed to protecting any
      information you provide while using the website. This Privacy Policy
      explains how non-personally identifiable information is collected and
      used.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
      When you visit UmaStitcher!, certain non-personally identifiable
      information, such as browser type, device type, and operating system, may
      be collected. This information is collected solely for the purpose of
      analyzing website traffic and improving the services provided. No
      personally identifiable information is collected as UmaStitcher! does not
      have a backend server or database to store such information.
    </p>

    <h2>Use of Google Analytics</h2>
    <p>
      UmaStitcher! uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by
      Google, Inc. ("Google"), to gather information about website usage. Google
      Analytics uses cookies to collect anonymous traffic data, which is
      transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. The
      data collected by Google Analytics is used to analyze website usage
      patterns and does not personally identify individual visitors.
    </p>

    <h2>Anonymized IP Addresses</h2>
    <p>
      To further protect your privacy, the IP anonymization feature in Google
      Analytics is enabled. This means that IP addresses are truncated by Google
      within member states of the European Union or other parties to the
      Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will
      the full IP address be transmitted to Google servers in the United States
      and truncated there. UmaStitcher! does not have access to the full IP
      addresses collected by Google Analytics.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      The data retention period for the non-personally identifiable information
      collected by Google Analytics is subject to Google's policy. For more
      information on Google's data retention practices, please refer to{" "}
